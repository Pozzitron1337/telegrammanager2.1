        My bot calls system call fork() and sets the pipeline between parent and child process.In child process pipein redirects to stdin and pipe out redirects to file "log.txt".Than child process calls execl() to execute telegram-cli.Parent process sends to child data stream by pipe.This data stream is telegram-cli commands.

## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

Write about 1-2 paragraphs describing the purpose of your bot.

## üí≠ How it works <a name = "working"></a>

The bot first extracts the word from the comment and then fetches word definitions, part of speech, example and source from the Oxford Dictionary API.

If the word does not exist in the Oxford Dictionary, the Oxford API then returns a 404 response upon which the bot then tries to fetch results form the Urban Dictionary API.

The bot uses the Pushshift API to fetch comments, PRAW module to reply to comments and Heroku as a server.

The entire bot is written in Python 3.6

## üéà Usage <a name = "usage"></a>

To use the bot, type:

1.

The first part, i.e. "!dict" **is not** case sensitive.

The bot will then give you the Oxford Dictionary (or Urban Dictionary; if the word does not exist in the Oxford Dictionary) definition of the word as a comment reply.

### Example:

> !dict what is love

**Definition:**

Baby, dont hurt me~
Dont hurt me~ no more.

**Example:**

Dude1: Bruh, what is love?
Dude2: Baby, dont hurt me, dont hurt me- no more!
Dude1: dafuq?

**Source:** https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=what%20is%20love
